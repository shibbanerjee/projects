#Write a program that continuous takes input of an input string and only stops if the keyword \end is passed.
#It give the output as follows --How are you? This is me.You dont say. Where are you?

#so any phrase question passed should end with a question mark otherwise it should end with a fullstop


#Steps: 
   
#    1. Define a function that takes in a phrase and capitalized it.
#    2. then it check if the phrase starts with question words and add return a ? with the phrase
#    3. Else it add a '.' to the end of the phrase
#    4. Start a while loop and ensure the user's input is lowercase with with the .lower method
#    5. Define an empty list
#    6. Break the loop if the user enters \end
#    7. else append the user inputs to the defined list
#    8. return the items of the list by joining them.
