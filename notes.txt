what is json

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data

JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page

JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand


How to load a json file?

To open a json file we can

import json

data = json.load(open("filename.json"))

But in case we are getting the same UnicodeEncodeError when saving scraped web content to a file. To fix it I replaced this code:

with open(fname) as f: #where fname is filename
    f.read()
with this:

import io
with io.open(fname, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.read()
Using io gives you backward compatibility with Python 2.

If you only need to support Python 3 you can use the builtin open function instead:

with open(fname, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.read()

Sequence matching -

Two useful ways :

Sequence matching can be done using the difflib builtin python library

1. Using sequence matcher() method from difflib library

Let us take the below example:

a = 'Thanks for calling American Expansion'
b = 'Thanks for calling American Express'

seq = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None,a,b)
d = seq.ratio()*100
print(d)
### OUTPUT: 88.88888

The value of D can be compared to check similarity of the word

2. Using get_close_matches()  method from difflib library
